# IMPORTANT! eventInterArrivalTime is in simulation time, while eventProcessingTime is in real time.
# Please keep the animation speed slider at 1.0! - Unless you explicitly test speed scaling.

[Config Smooth]
description = No-op events only
**.animator.eventInterArrivalTime = 1s
**.animator.eventProcessingTime = 0s

[Config RegularJerks]
description = A small skip every second.
**.animator.eventInterArrivalTime = 1s
**.animator.eventProcessingTime = 0.1s

[Config RegularLongJerks]
description = Siginificant jerks, but simTime should keep up.
**.animator.eventInterArrivalTime = 1s
**.animator.eventProcessingTime = 0.8s

[Config RegularShortJerks]
description = Smaller skips, more often, simTime should still (barely) keep up.
**.animator.eventInterArrivalTime = 0.1s
**.animator.eventProcessingTime = uniform(0.02s, 0.03s)

[Config OverloadedSlow]
description = SimTime can't progresss faster than half real time, animation can't be smoother than 10 fps.
**.animator.eventInterArrivalTime = 0.1s
**.animator.eventProcessingTime = uniform(0.15s, 0.25s)

[Config OverloadedFast]
description = Same as above, but the framerate shouldn't drop so much.
**.animator.eventInterArrivalTime = 0.01s
**.animator.eventProcessingTime = uniform(0.015s, 0.025s)
